This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in React Native, often stemming from asynchronous operations where data hasn't loaded yet or components render before data fetching is complete.

```javascript
// Example of a component that might cause this error
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userData: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ userData: data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.userData.name}</Text> {/* This line might throw the error */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

The error will occur because `this.state.userData` is initially `null`, and trying to access `.name` before the data has been fetched from the API will cause a runtime error.
